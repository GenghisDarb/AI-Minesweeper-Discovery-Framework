# AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework

A constraint-satisfaction engine that turns any knowledge domain into a Minesweeper-style board of hypotheses and uncovers true patterns through active learning loops.

## Introduction

The AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is designed to facilitate the exploration and discovery of patterns within complex datasets. By leveraging constraint satisfaction techniques, this framework transforms knowledge domains into interactive Minesweeper-style boards, allowing users to engage in active learning and hypothesis testing.

## Key Concepts

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: The framework employs constraint satisfaction algorithms to manage and solve problems within the defined knowledge domain.
- **Active Learning**: Users can iteratively refine their hypotheses based on feedback from the system, enhancing the discovery process.
- **Minesweeper-style Interface**: The interactive board provides a familiar interface for users to explore and uncover patterns.

## Usage

To get started with the AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework, follow the quick start instructions provided in the README.

## Conclusion

The AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework represents a novel approach to data exploration and hypothesis generation. By combining constraint satisfaction with an engaging interface, it empowers users to uncover insights and drive discovery in their respective fields.
