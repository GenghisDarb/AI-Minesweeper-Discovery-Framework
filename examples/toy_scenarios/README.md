# Toy Scenario

This folder contains a simple toy scenario for testing the AI-Minesweeper framework.

## Files
- `toy_board.json`: A simple 3-cell board configuration.
- `toy_run.py`: A script to load the board, run a confidence oscillation sweep, and output a log.
- `toy_run.log`: The output log generated by the script.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to this folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python toy_run.py
   ```
3. Check the `toy_run.log` file for the output.

## Expected Output
The log will contain the state of the board after each move, showing how the solver progresses through the toy scenario.

## Notes
This board contains 2 known false hypotheses, for demo purposes only. In discovery mode, false hypotheses are not revealed or counted in advance. This distinction helps users understand the difference between:

- **Evaluation Scenarios**: Labeled boards for testing and benchmarking.
- **Open Discovery Mode**: No prior labels; hypotheses are resolved dynamically.
