# Confidence Oscillation Run

This example demonstrates a confidence oscillation run using the toy board.

## Toy Board

```
1,0,0,1,0
0,1,1,0,0
0,0,1,0,1
1,0,0,1,0
0,1,0,0,1
```

## Expected Output

- Initial confidence: 0.8
- Decay rate (Ï„): 0.5
- Period: 3 steps

The solver should stabilize confidence levels after approximately 5 steps.
