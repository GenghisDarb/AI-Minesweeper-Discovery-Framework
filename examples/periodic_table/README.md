# Periodic Table Demo

This demo explores gaps and anomalies in the periodic table. Each cell represents an element, with adjacency defined by group and period.

## Goals
- Discover unfilled positions (eka-elements).
- Analyze patterns in atomic properties.

## Data
The dataset (`elements.csv`) includes atomic number, symbol, group, period, and other properties.

## Logic
- **Neighbors**: Same group or same period.
- **Mines**: Unfilled positions.
- **Clues**: Count of unfilled neighbors.
