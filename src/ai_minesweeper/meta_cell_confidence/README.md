# Meta-Cell Confidence Module

## Overview
The Meta-Cell Confidence Module enhances the AI Discovery Framework by introducing a feedback mechanism that dynamically adjusts the hypothesis solver's strategy based on its confidence. Inspired by TORUS Theory, this module acts as a controller that stabilizes the solver's decision-making process, ensuring a balance between cautious exploration and bold exploitation.

## Features
- **Bayesian Confidence Tracking**: Tracks the solver's calibration using a Beta distribution.
- **Dynamic Risk Adjustment**: Adjusts the risk threshold based on confidence levels.
- **Self-Correcting Feedback Loop**: Learns from past performance to improve decision-making.

## Usage
### Enabling the Module
To enable the Meta-Cell Confidence Module, wrap the solver with the `ConfidencePolicy` class:

```python
from ai_minesweeper.meta_cell_confidence.confidence import BetaConfidence, ConfidencePolicy

# Initialize the confidence tracker and policy
confidence = BetaConfidence()
policy = ConfidencePolicy(base_solver, confidence)

# Use the policy to choose moves
move = policy.choose_move(board)
```

### Adjusting Risk Threshold
The risk threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the confidence level. You can manually set the threshold using:

```python
confidence.set_threshold(0.1)  # Set a custom threshold
```

## Theory
The module draws inspiration from TORUS Theory's controller dimension, which ensures stability in recursive systems. Similarly, the Meta-Cell Confidence Module uses a feedback loop to modulate the solver's risk-taking behavior, mimicking the periodic reset and self-correction observed in TORUS's \\chi-cycle.

## Results
Empirical tests show that the confidence-aware solver achieves higher success rates and exhibits a characteristic oscillatory pattern in confidence levels, confirming the intended behavior.

## Future Work
- **Visualization**: Add a confidence bar to the hypothesis solver UI.
