"""Meta-Cell Confidence Module.

This package adds a controller-layer feedback loop to the Minesweeper AI, enabling
the solver to self-calibrate its confidence. Inspired by TORUS Theory’s recursion
closure and the “ghost rider” bicycle effect, the module introduces a meta-cell that
tracks prediction accuracy and adjusts the solver's risk policy dynamically.
