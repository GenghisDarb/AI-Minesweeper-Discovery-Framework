# Torus of Tori and DPP-14

This document provides theoretical background on the Torus-of-Tori architecture and the DPP-14 recursion engine:

- Overview of the Torus structure in χ-recursive decision loops
- Mathematical grounding for Phase Reset Protocol 14 (DPP-14)
- Interaction between confidence tracking and recursion depth

(Placeholder content — to be expanded with equations, diagrams, and code examples.)
