# Why TORUS Matters

TORUS Theory provides the mathematical foundation for the Minesweeper Discovery Framework. Key principles include:

## χ-Cycle
A recursive pattern observed in complex systems, validated with 8-σ evidence.

## Controller Dimension
Stabilizes recursive cycles, enabling breakthroughs in dynamic systems.

## Applications
- **Gravitational Waves**: Noise pattern analysis.
- **Prime Spirals**: Residue pattern predictions.
- **Periodic Table**: Discovery of super-heavy elements.
