# Why TORUS Matters

The χ-cycle and controller dimension principles are central to the Minesweeper Discovery Framework (MDF). These concepts enable hypothesis discovery by transforming complex domains into Minesweeper-style puzzles.

## χ-cycle
The χ-cycle represents recursive patterns in data, such as prime residue distributions or noise patterns in gravitational wave detectors.

## Controller Dimension
Controller dimension theory explains dynamic stabilization in systems, such as bicycle ghost-rider simulations.
