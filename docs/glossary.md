# Glossary & FAQ

## Glossary

### χ-cycle

Recursive patterns in data, such as prime residue distributions or noise patterns.

### Controller Dimension

Theory explaining dynamic stabilization in systems.

### ERC

Empirical Recursive Cycle, a statistical measure of χ-cycle significance.

For more terms, refer to the TORUS Theory paper.

## FAQ

### What is the significance of 8-σ evidence?

8-σ corresponds to a 1 in 10¹⁵ chance of coincidence, indicating extremely high credibility.

### How does the controller dimension apply to Minesweeper?

It modulates the solver's risk tolerance, balancing exploration and exploitation phases.

### What domains has TORUS Theory been validated in?

Gravitational wave detectors, prime spirals, and dynamic systems like bicycle stabilization.
