# Glossary & FAQ

## Glossary
- **χ-Cycle**: A recursive oscillatory pattern predicted by TORUS Theory (~14 moves).
- **Controller Dimension**: A stabilizing layer in recursive systems, ensuring balanced cycles.
- **ERC**: Empirical Recursive Calibration, a method for validating recursive predictions.
- **TORUS-brot**: A TORUS-theory inspired fractal analogous to the Mandelbrot set, exhibiting 14-fold symmetry (χ-cycle) instead of period-doubling.
- **Meta-Cell**: A meta-level "cell" or module in the solver that monitors and adjusts the solver’s confidence, inspired by TORUS’s controller dimension.

## FAQ
### What is the significance of 8-σ evidence?
8-σ corresponds to a 1 in 10¹⁵ chance of coincidence, indicating extremely high credibility.

### How does the controller dimension apply to Minesweeper?
It modulates the solver's risk tolerance, balancing exploration and exploitation phases.

### What domains has TORUS Theory been validated in?
Gravitational wave detectors, prime spirals, and dynamic systems like bicycle stabilization.
