# Contributor Guide

## Extending TORUS-brot

- Experiment with higher-order fractals or link with external fractal libraries.
- Explore mini "satellite" copies and measure their scaling to compare with Feigenbaum’s delta for χ-cycle.
- Introduce random variations each iteration to mimic observer effects and analyze fractal boundary deformation.

## Improving Meta-Cell

- Implement more sophisticated Bayesian updates or alternative risk strategies.
- Enhance confidence visualization with historical trends or interactive charts.
- Optimize solver integration for larger boards or complex domains.

## General Contribution Tips

- Follow the modular design principles outlined in the README.
- Ensure all new features are documented and tested.
- Run `pytest` to verify that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
