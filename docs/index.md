# AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework

The AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the development and testing of AI algorithms for the classic Minesweeper game. It provides a robust environment for researchers and enthusiasts to explore various AI techniques and strategies, enabling them to understand and improve the performance of their algorithms in a controlled setting.

With a focus on ease of use and extensibility, the framework offers a range of features including customizable game boards, AI agent integration, and performance analysis tools. Whether you're a seasoned AI researcher or a newcomer to the field, this framework provides the resources you need to delve into the world of AI-driven Minesweeper.

## Installation

To install the framework, use the following command:

```bash
pip install ai-minesweeper-framework
```

## Quick CLI Example

Here's a quick example of how to run a Minesweeper game with an AI agent using the CLI:

```bash
ai-minesweeper --agent=random --board-size=10 --mines=15
```

This command runs a Minesweeper game on a 10x10 board with 15 mines, using a random AI agent.
