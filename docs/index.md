# AI Hypothesis Discovery Framework

The AI Hypothesis Discovery Framework is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the development and testing of AI algorithms for systematic hypothesis exploration. It provides a robust environment for researchers and enthusiasts to explore various AI techniques and strategies, enabling them to understand and improve the performance of their algorithms in a controlled setting.

With a focus on ease of use and extensibility, the framework offers a range of features including customizable hypothesis grids, AI agent integration, and performance analysis tools. Whether you're a seasoned AI researcher or a newcomer to the field, this framework provides the resources you need to delve into the world of AI-driven hypothesis discovery.

## Installation

To install the framework, use the following command:

```bash
pip install ai-hypothesis-discovery-framework
```

## Quick CLI Example

Here's a quick example of how to run a hypothesis discovery session with an AI agent using the CLI:

```bash
ai-hypothesis-discovery --agent=random --grid-size=10 --false-hypotheses=15
```

This command runs a hypothesis discovery session on a 10x10 grid with 15 false hypotheses, using a random AI agent.
