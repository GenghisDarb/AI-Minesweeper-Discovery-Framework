# Roadmap Overview

## Theory

TORUS Theory introduces recursive self-correction mechanisms in complex systems, leveraging the χ-cycle and controller dimension to stabilize oscillatory behavior.

## Simulation

Simulations validate χ-cycle predictions across domains:

- Gravitational wave noise patterns.
- Prime residue spirals.
- Dynamic systems like bicycle stabilization.

## Empirical Tests

Empirical validations demonstrate 8-σ evidence:

- Gravitational wave detectors: χ-cycle in noise patterns.
- Prime spirals: Recursive residue patterns.
- Bicycle ghost-rider: Controller dimension stabilization.

## Open Falsifiers

Future work includes:

- Extending χ-cycle predictions to new domains.
- Testing controller dimension in protein-folding dynamics.
- Exploring legal precedent graphs for recursive patterns.
