# Discovering φ-Phase Reset

This tutorial explores the φ-phase reset phenomenon in hypothesis discovery. It demonstrates how the χ-cycle interacts with phase-locking mechanisms to achieve dynamic calibration.

## Instructions
Run the associated notebook `notebooks/discovering_phi_phase_reset.ipynb` to observe the φ-phase reset in action.
