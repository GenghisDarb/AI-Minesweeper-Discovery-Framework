# Prime Residue Recursion

The Prime Residue Recursion test explores how the χ-cycle modulates confidence across prime residue classes. The Wolfram script `prime_residue_scan.wls` generates the data for this test.

## Overview
The χ-cycle aligns with prime residue classes, demonstrating periodic confidence oscillations. This test validates the solver's ability to adapt dynamically to prime residue patterns.

## Data Generation
Run the Wolfram script `prime_residue_scan.wls` to generate the required data for this test.
