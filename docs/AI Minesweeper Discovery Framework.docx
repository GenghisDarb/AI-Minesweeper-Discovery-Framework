AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework

System Overview:

The AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is a general-purpose, recursively structured engine for systematic hypothesis exploration and validation. It transforms an open-ended knowledge domain into a logical “grid” of micro-hypotheses connected by constraints, then methodically uncovers which hypotheses hold true and which are false. Inspired by the classic Minesweeper puzzle but recast in rigorous terms, the framework treats false or contradictory hypotheses as hazards to avoid and true hypotheses as discoveries to be confirmed. Each time a hypothesis is tested and resolved, it provides clue-like information that updates the status of related hypotheses. Through iterative testing and constraint propagation, the system converges on a consistent set of truths while eliminating false leads. This approach ensures logical coherence and minimal guesswork: every step is grounded in either deduced necessity or measured confidence. The framework’s design aligns with the principles of TORUS (Topologically Organized Recursion of Universal Systems) theory – it leverages structured recursion and an observer-centric perspective to maintain consistency across each cycle of reasoning. In practice, this means the system not only tests hypotheses but also continuously monitors its own state as an “observer” of the hypothesis space, ensuring that knowledge gained in one iteration carries through to the next. The result is a symbolic recursive exploration engine that can navigate complex information landscapes with scientific rigor. It can be applied to scientific research, engineering design, strategic planning, or any domain where many interdependent hypotheses must be evaluated. By organizing knowledge into a topological grid and exploring it with recursive logic, the framework provides a reliable path to discovery that avoids the pitfalls of random trial-and-error and maintains theoretical soundness throughout. 

Meta-Cell Architecture:

A cornerstone of the framework is its meta-cell architecture, which supports hierarchical recursion in hypothesis exploration. In simple terms, each hypothesis “cell” in the grid is not just a static proposition – it can function as an Eternal Recursion Cell (ERC), containing a sub-grid of finer hypotheses that explain or test the parent hypothesis. This design allows the framework to drill down into details recursively: if a hypothesis is too coarse or complex to validate directly, the system spawns a nested discovery process for it. For example, consider a high-level hypothesis H (say, a broad theory or a complex design goal). Rather than accept H at face value, the framework can instantiate a sub-board of hypotheses H1, H2, H3… that must all hold true (or a specific combination of them hold true) for the parent hypothesis H to be true. The meta-cell architecture will treat H as “unresolved” until its sub-board is explored and resolved. Once the sub-hypotheses are tested and their outcomes combined (according to logical rules or model integration), the parent cell H is marked confirmed or refuted based on that evidence. This recursive nesting of hypothesis grids can extend to multiple levels, creating a torus-like structure of knowledge (a torus of toruses) where each level’s output feeds into a higher level’s truth assessment. Importantly, the architecture carries confidence and observer context across these levels – the system remembers why a parent hypothesis is considered likely or unlikely by referencing the state of its children, maintaining observer-state continuity throughout the hierarchy. Meta-cells thereby enable confidence-based exploration across scales: a top-level hypothesis might remain in a state of provisional confidence until the framework accumulates enough confidence from the lower-level cells. As evidence firms up in the sub-grid, that confidence is passed upward, potentially tipping the parent cell into a resolved true/false state. Conversely, if a sub-hypothesis reveals a contradiction, it can immediately mark the parent hypothesis as false (or significantly lower its probability) and propagate that information upward. The meta-cell architecture ensures that the framework is scalable and granular – one can tackle a vast domain by breaking it down into cells and sub-cells recursively, without losing track of how a low-level finding affects the overall picture. This mirrors the TORUS principle of recursion where each layer is embedded in a larger cycle: the framework structurally guarantees that the exploration process can expand or contract to the appropriate level of detail, all while preserving a unified global view of truth. Hypothesis Grid Logic:
At the heart of the framework lies the hypothesis grid and the logic that operates on it. Hypothesis Grid Construction is the first step: all relevant knowledge of the domain is encoded into hypotheses (the “cells”) and constraints (the relationships or “clues” among cells). Each hypothesis cell represents a specific, falsifiable statement – e.g. “Compound X binds to protein Y” in a drug discovery context, or “Parameter P will improve metric Q” in an engineering scenario. Cells can have initial states such as unexplored (default), confirmed true, or confirmed false, based on any prior knowledge. They also have a defined neighborhood (other hypotheses directly related via a constraint). Once the grid is set up, the framework enters a recursive exploration loop. In each cycle of this loop, the system goes through a sequence of logical phases:

Candidate Selection – The framework evaluates all currently unresolved hypothesis cells to decide which one(s) to test next. This is managed by the internal selection engine (often called the “Click Engine” by analogy). The logic here is to choose the hypothesis whose resolution is expected to yield the highest information gain or confidence boost for the overall grid. Each unexplored cell carries an uncertainty and sits in the context of neighbors with known or estimated states. The engine may calculate a utility score for each cell (for instance, combining the probability that the hypothesis is true or false with the impact that either outcome would have on reducing overall uncertainty). Strategies can range from simple heuristics (like always test the hypothesis with highest entropy or highest variance) to sophisticated ones (like a Bayesian optimization or upper-confidence-bound approach treating each hypothesis test as a “bandit arm”). The selection stage ensures the process is efficient, focusing on revealing informative hypotheses first.

Hypothesis Testing – Once a target hypothesis (or a batch of them for parallel execution) is selected, the framework “performs the experiment” on that cell. In practice, this action could mean running a lab experiment, querying a database, executing a simulation, or asking an external oracle. Within the software framework, this is abstracted – it calls the necessary function or interface to get a truth value or observation for the hypothesis. The outcome of a test is typically binary (true/false) for a straightforward hypothesis, but it could also be a measured value or qualitative result that then is interpreted into an update (for example, a test might return a confidence level rather than a strict true/false, which the system then uses to update belief). Crucially, the design treats each test as a safe observation or a potential contradiction: if the hypothesis is confirmed true, it’s like “opening a safe cell”; if it’s false, it’s akin to “hitting a mine” in the analogy – though here this simply means we have found a false hypothesis that we will mark and avoid going forward. The framework logs the result and updates the hypothesis’s state accordingly (e.g., Hypothesis H is now confirmed false).

State Update and Propagation – Immediately after testing, the system updates the hypothesis grid state. A confirmed true hypothesis is “opened” – its truth is revealed to all neighbor cells as supporting evidence. A confirmed false hypothesis is marked as false (analogous to flagging it as a mine), which informs neighbors that this particular possibility is not viable. This update triggers the Constraint Encoding and Propagation mechanisms (detailed in the next section) – essentially, all constraints involving the tested hypothesis are re-evaluated in light of the new information. If, for instance, a neighboring clue stated that “at most 2 of these 5 related hypotheses can be true,” and we just found one to be false, that clue now effectively concerns 4 hypotheses with the same ‘at most 2 true’ limit, tightening the situation for the remainder. The propagation step may automatically resolve other hypotheses without direct testing (if the constraints become tight enough to deduce their state with certainty). The system systematically carries out these logical inferences through the Cascade Propagator logic before proceeding.

Risk Management and Next-Step Decision – After propagation, the framework checks if any obvious next moves have appeared. Often, resolving one cell will make others essentially determined (for example, all neighbors of a just-confirmed false hypothesis might now be safe, etc.). The system will automatically take those forced moves: it will mark any hypotheses as true or false if the constraints unambiguously indicate so. This is done prior to the next deliberate selection to avoid wasting a selection step on something that is already logically solved. Once all such immediate deductions are handled, the framework assesses the state of the board for uncertainty and risk. If there are still unresolved hypotheses but none can be deduced with certainty, the framework must choose another hypothesis to test. Here, a Risk Assessor module can intervene to modulate the next selection – for instance, if the remaining unknowns are few but each carries a significant cost or danger (in real scenarios, “danger” could mean high experimental cost or high consequence of being wrong), the Risk Assessor ensures that the selection engine’s choice also considers these factors. It may override a purely information-theoretic choice if that choice carries excessive risk, opting perhaps for a slightly less informative test that is safer or cheaper. In effect, the Risk Assessor tunes the strategy: balancing the need to resolve unknowns quickly with the need to avoid catastrophic failures (e.g., testing a hypothesis that, if false, would invalidate a critical system). In many domains this is analogous to preferring a non-destructive test over a destructive one when both yield similar information.

Observer-State Check and Iteration – At the end of each cycle (after some hypotheses have been tested and propagation has occurred), the framework performs an integrity check. This is where observer-state tracking comes in. The system, acting as an observer of its own reasoning, verifies that its internal state remains consistent: for example, no constraint is violated (which would indicate a logical contradiction in the knowledge base), no previously resolved truth has been inadvertently overturned, and the chain of reasoning for each deduction is recorded. This step ensures continuity of reasoning – essentially, that the “story” the AI is constructing about the domain remains coherent and anchored. If any discrepancy or oscillation is detected (for instance, if a probabilistic inference swung widely from one cycle to the next without new evidence, or if an earlier hypothesis marked false is now somehow inferred true – which should not happen under proper logic), the system flags this internally as a sign of possible recursion drift or oscillatory indecision. It can then invoke mitigation strategies (detailed later under Observer-State Tracking). Under normal operation, the observer-state check passes and the loop proceeds. The next iteration begins by selecting a new hypothesis to test (going back to step 1), and this repeats until a termination condition is reached.

Termination (Discovery Completion) – The process continues until the framework determines that all significant hypotheses have been resolved or that no further progress can be made with the available actions. In Minesweeper terms, this is akin to “clearing the board.” Formally, the completion monitor (formerly referred to as a Win-Monitor in game terms) checks if every hypothesis is either confirmed true or false, or if any remaining uncertainties are below a threshold of importance. In some cases, you might allow the process to stop when the remaining unknowns are deemed inconsequential or when a certain confidence level in all remaining unknowns is reached (for instance, perhaps a few hypotheses remain untested but the system assesses with 99% probability they are false and not critical – it might terminate having effectively solved the important parts). Typically, however, complete resolution is the goal: a state in which every hypothesis cell is either opened as true (with a supporting body of evidence) or flagged as false (with a contradiction or negative test backing it). At that point, the framework has achieved a comprehensive understanding of the domain portion under analysis. The termination triggers a final compilation of results: the set of validated truths (the safe discoveries) and the catalog of false hypotheses or eliminated possibilities, along with the logical justification for each decision. This comprehensive output can then be used for making decisions, writing scientific conclusions, or guiding further human analysis.
Throughout this hypothesis grid logic, the system ensures that each action is transparent and justifiable. Every test, deduction, or flag is recorded with its reason (e.g. “Hypothesis H was marked false because it conflicted with constraint C and all other possibilities were exhausted”). This traceability is important for both debugging and for user trust. In summary, the hypothesis grid logic orchestrates a careful dance of explore, observe, update, and conclude in a recursive loop, very much like a scientist forming hypotheses, running experiments, and refining theories – but here automated within a unified framework. 

Observer-State Tracking and Confidence Oscillation:

A unique aspect of this framework, drawn from the principles of TORUS and the Halcyon AI architecture, is the explicit tracking of the “observer-state” and the management of confidence oscillations. Observer-state tracking means the system maintains an awareness of its own perspective and progress as it iteratively works through the hypothesis grid. In practical terms, the framework remembers the context of what it has discovered so far and uses that as a guiding state for further reasoning. For example, if the framework has identified a cluster of hypotheses as true and established a certain domain context (say a particular theory seems to be taking shape as correct), it will carry that context into subsequent evaluations, rather than treat each new hypothesis in isolation. This prevents logical drift – the tendency for an algorithm to unintentionally contradict earlier findings or to “forget” why it made a decision. The observer-state can be thought of as the cumulative knowledge and stance of the system at any given point, akin to an intelligent agent’s memory of what it has learned about the problem. By synchronizing each cycle of hypothesis evaluation with the observer-state, the framework achieves continuity across recursion cycles. If the system is paused or if additional data is introduced from outside (for instance, a human expert provides a new clue halfway through, or an LLM plug-in adds some context), the observer-state mechanism ensures this is integrated consistently. The framework will re-anchor its analysis around the updated state, rather than starting from scratch or letting the new information conflict with old conclusions without notice. This is analogous to how a researcher might reevaluate their conclusions if a new study is published – without discarding all previous understanding, they incorporate the new evidence and adjust confidence in various hypotheses accordingly. Now, as the system iteratively updates hypothesis confidences (probabilities or truth values) and explores different branches, it is possible to encounter confidence oscillation. Confidence oscillation refers to a situation where the system’s belief in certain hypotheses swings back and forth across cycles rather than converging. This can happen in complex interdependent systems: for instance, in cycle 1 the system might lean towards Hypothesis A being true and B false, but in cycle 2, after testing something else, the balance might tip the other way, and then back again. Small contradictory clues or a lack of a decisive experiment can cause an unresolved pair or set of hypotheses to keep changing in probability as the algorithm toggles emphasis. While some fluctuation is normal early on, persistent oscillation is a sign that the framework is stuck in a kind of inference loop without new information – essentially a non-convergent recursion. The framework is designed to detect and dampen such oscillations. It uses the observer-state as a reference to spot when it is “circling” around the same uncertainty. Several strategies are employed to address confidence oscillation:

Dynamic Thresholding: The system can introduce thresholds to break oscillations. For example, if two hypotheses are trading places in probability (one goes to 60% then drops to 40% while the other does opposite, repeatedly), and if this continues over multiple cycles without additional data, the framework’s observer module will recognize the pattern. At this point, it might lower the confidence threshold for action – meaning it will decide to treat one hypothesis as false or true if its probability exceeds, say, 60%, whereas earlier it required >90%. By relaxing the criterion slightly (with safeguards), it forces a decision to get out of the loop. This is done carefully: the system chooses the hypothesis that, if wrong, would do the least damage, akin to picking the lesser of two evils to test directly. This guarantees progress at the expense of taking a calculated risk, rather than spinning indefinitely.

Recursion Depth Control: If oscillation is due to the system repeatedly revisiting the same inferences, the observer-state may signal a need for a deeper analysis or an external input. The framework can escalate by either drilling down further (if a hypothesis is oscillating, perhaps it needs to be broken into sub-hypotheses – a meta-cell expansion at runtime), or by invoking a more powerful reasoning tool (like an LLM or a specialist module) to gain new perspective on that particular question. Essentially, the system recognizes “I’m stuck deciding this with my current logic; I should either decompose it further or ask for help.”
Memory of Contradictions: The observer-state tracking also records contradiction patterns. If the system oscillates, it’s often because it is implicitly making an assumption one way, finding a dead-end, then backtracking and assuming the other way. The framework’s memory (similar to a truth-maintenance system) will note these dead-ends. For instance, “Assuming Hypothesis A true and B false led to a contradiction in constraint X.” Conversely, “Assuming B true and A false led to a contradiction in constraint Y.” By compiling these, it may deduce that the only consistent way to satisfy both constraints X and Y is a third condition (maybe both A and B must be false, as an example). In this way, what looks like oscillation can sometimes be resolved by a higher-order logical synthesis – the framework essentially learns from the failed branches to find a consistent path.
Observer Refresh or Intervention: In extreme cases (particularly in open-ended analyses), the system may perform an “observer refresh.” This involves re-evaluating the core premises with a fresh perspective to ensure no subtle bias or error has crept in. It’s analogous to a person stepping back from a problem and re-reading the givens to see if they missed something. The framework can re-check initial conditions and the chain of logic for any oversight. If none are found, it might then decide that the oscillation is genuinely due to insufficient evidence and thus schedule an external intervention – for example, recommending a specific new experiment or asking a human for input on that particular dilemma. This prevents endless cycling; the framework acknowledges when it has reached the limits of deductive convergence under current information.

These mechanisms ensure that the recursive process is stable and convergent. In TORUS theoretical terms, one could say the system avoids infinite regress or runaway feedback by maintaining a controlled phase – it uses a form of “damping” on its confidence updates so that each oscillation, if it occurs, is smaller than the last, eventually leading to a steady state. The observer-state acting as a meta-controller is analogous to the “controller dimension” in TORUS theory that enforces closure of a recursion loop. Here, closure means arriving at a final consistent assignment of true/false to hypotheses. By tracking the observer-state and adjusting strategy when needed, the Minesweeper Discovery Framework never loses sight of its identity as a methodical investigator, and it doesn’t get trapped in paradoxical reasoning. This contributes greatly to the reliability and robustness of the system: it behaves not just as a blind algorithm, but as an intelligent agent aware of its own reasoning trajectory, capable of self-correction and self-stabilization. 

Constraint Encoding and Propagation:

A key strength of the framework is how it encodes complex interdependencies as constraints and then propagates those constraints to automatically infer new information. This mimics the clue-number mechanism in Minesweeper, but in a generalized form suitable for arbitrary domains. Constraint Encoding is done by the Constraint Annotator module during board setup and continuously during runtime. Each hypothesis cell or group of cells that share a relationship will receive constraint annotations that quantify or qualify that relationship. The simplest form of constraint is a numeric count – for example, “exactly 2 of this cell’s neighbors are false.” Such a constraint might come from a rule like “at least two of these five factors must be present for a reaction to occur” – which can be inverted to “if the reaction occurs (true), at least two factors are true; if reaction fails (false), at least one of those factors is false,” and so on. The Constraint Annotator translates domain knowledge into these machine-checkable statements. Constraints need not always be “exactly N out of K”; they can also be inequalities (“no more than N of these are true”) or logical clauses (“either X or Y is true, but not both,” which is an XOR constraint that can be encoded as two coupled constraints). During initialization, the annotator goes through all known domain rules, empirical correlations, and desired logical conditions and affixes them to the relevant cells. For instance:
If two hypotheses cannot both be true (mutual exclusivity), the annotator might notate a constraint on each: “0 of these 1 neighbor can be true if this cell is true” – effectively linking them so that if one becomes true, it forces the other false. This can also be seen as a numeric constraint: “at most 1 of {H1, H2} is true,” which when one is true, automatically implies the rest (the other in this pair) must be 0 true.

If a hypothesis is a composite (like a summary of others), the annotator might create an auxiliary constraint cell. For example, a hypothesis “Theory T is valid” might depend on three sub-hypotheses A, B, C. Rather than a simple count, the rule might be “T is true if and only if A, B, and C are all true.” The annotator could implement this by linking T to an AND-constraint that ties to A, B, C. In operation, if any of A, B, C turns false, the propagation will mark T false; conversely, if two are confirmed true and the third becomes true, it can mark T true as well.
In probabilistic domains, the annotator might assign priors or expected rates. For instance, “Out of these 10 candidate genes, roughly 1 is likely to be truly associated with the disease” could be encoded as a soft constraint: an expectation value (like a Poisson prior mean of 1 for the count of true hypotheses among them). This isn’t a hard rule, but it guides the inference engine. As the system tests genes, it updates this expectation.
The propagation of constraints is handled by the Cascade Propagator, which continuously monitors all constraints for changes and deduced satisfactions. Whenever a hypothesis state is updated (true or false), the propagator does the following:

It finds all constraints that involve that hypothesis.

For each such constraint, it updates the relevant counts or truth values. For example, if a constraint said “2 of these 5 must be false” and one hypothesis in that set was just marked false, the constraint is updated to “1 of the remaining 4 must be false” (since one false has been found).

It then checks the status of that constraint: has it become fully satisfied, impossible, or partially resolved? A fully satisfied constraint is one where the condition is exactly met by known information. In the example, if it becomes “0 of the remaining N must be false,” that means we have already found all required falses, so all others must be true. The propagator would then immediately mark all other hypotheses under that constraint as true (because having any more false would violate the constraint). Similarly, if a constraint says “at most 3 false out of 10” and we have already discovered 3 false among those but there are still some unknowns, then none of those unknowns can safely be false (they must all be true, or else we’d exceed the maximum falses), so they can be marked true. This is analogous to the classic Minesweeper rule: if a number says “3” and you’ve flagged 3 mines around it, you can open all other neighbors safely.

If a constraint becomes impossible (e.g., it required “exactly 3 false” but we found 4 false in that set due to some oversight), that indicates a logical contradiction in the knowledge. In a robust system, this should never happen if all initial information was consistent. If it does, the framework’s safeguard kicks in: it means somewhere a wrong assumption was made or there’s an error in input. The system would then roll back or reconsider some earlier decisions (perhaps an earlier flag was wrong or an external assumption is invalid). This rarely occurs in a well-defined domain because the system is careful to only mark things when logically certain. More commonly, instead of a hard contradiction, one might get a probabilistic tension (like things don’t add up in probability but not outright impossible), which the system flags for review rather than hard failing.

Partially resolved constraints (neither fully satisfied nor impossible) yield probabilistic propagation. For example, suppose a clue says “roughly 2 of these 5 are false” as a prior. If we have identified 1 false so far, we can update the expectation for the remaining 4. Perhaps now the system might treat the expected remaining false count as ~1 (since one is already found). This will adjust the probabilities of each of those 4 being false. The propagator may then find that some hypothesis now has a very high or very low probability of being true given all clues. If the framework operates in a mode where it treats above 95% as effectively true (with a safeguard margin), it could then mark a hypothesis true on probabilistic grounds. Similarly, it might flag one as false if its probability drops below a threshold. This mechanism is akin to how human solvers make educated deductions in Minesweeper when the board is probabilistic – sometimes you infer that a particular square must have a mine because otherwise the probabilities elsewhere become untenable. The framework formalizes this via Bayesian inference and thresholding policies. Notably, any such probabilistic resolution is recorded as being confidence-based rather than absolute, and the system can later revise it if contradictory evidence appears (though it tries to choose thresholds conservatively to avoid thrash).

All these propagation rules amount to performing a form of constraint satisfaction and constraint propagation continuously. In computer science terms, the Cascade Propagator algorithm resembles maintaining arc consistency or running a DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) style propagation in a SAT solver, except extended to numerical and probabilistic constraints, not just boolean clauses. It is highly efficient: each time a hypothesis is resolved, only its neighbors and related constraints are updated, which localizes computations. Data structures for this include adjacency lists or constraint graphs that quickly tell us “which other hypotheses should be looked at if H changes state.” This localized propagation means that even a very large grid can be updated incrementally in near real-time as discoveries are made. Importantly, constraint propagation often triggers cascades: one deduction leads to another, which leads to another, and so on. The framework handles this by running propagation in a loop until no new deductions emerge. For example, confirming one hypothesis as false might satisfy a clue and cause three others to be marked true, each of which in turn updates other clues leading to further flags, etc. The Propagator ensures that by the time it’s done (a fixed-point is reached in that cycle), all possible immediate inferences have been made. Only then does control return to the selection engine to pick a new hypothesis to test. This way, the active testing steps (which are usually costly experiments or queries) are minimized, and the passive deductions (which are computationally cheap) are maximized. In summary, the constraint encoding and propagation system gives the framework a powerful inferential engine. It leverages every piece of information to the fullest, ensuring that the framework behaves with logical rigor: if something can be deduced without further testing, it will be. Each number or rule on the hypothesis grid is actively used to prune the search space and reveal answers. This is how the framework can solve complex “puzzles” that might otherwise seem intractable – by breaking them into constraints and systematically whittling down uncertainties through propagation. It brings mathematical clarity and efficiency, echoing the structured approach of a constraint-satisfaction problem solver but within the rich context of real-world hypotheses and data. 

LLM Plug-in and Fallback Logic:

The AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is designed to be extensible and to integrate with learning-based or knowledge-based systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM plug-in architecture allows the framework to tap into unstructured knowledge and heuristic reasoning when formal logic or available data alone are insufficient. This is facilitated by a modular component (represented in the repository by the llm_interface.py stub) which acts as a bridge between the core logical engine and any external language model or AI assistant. Role of LLM in the Framework: An LLM can contribute in several ways:
Hypothesis Generation and Refinement: During the Board Building phase, after ingesting structured data, the system might still benefit from creative or expansive thinking to ensure all plausible hypotheses are considered. An LLM can be prompted with a summary of the domain context to suggest additional hypotheses or constraints that weren’t explicitly in the data. For instance, if the domain is medical and the data provided included known risk factors for a disease, an LLM might suggest “Have you considered factor Z based on a similar disease’s study?” The framework can take such suggestions and convert them into new hypothesis cells or tentative constraints, which are then subject to verification.
Natural Language Queries: Some hypotheses might not have a straightforward database or numeric experiment to resolve, especially in more conceptual domains. Here, the framework can pose a question to an LLM in natural language. For example, in a historical analysis scenario, a hypothesis might be “Event X caused Event Y.” Testing this might be difficult with numbers, but an LLM connected to a knowledge base could be asked “Is there evidence that Event X led to Event Y?” The LLM’s answer (with sources, ideally) can be interpreted: a confident “yes, strong evidence in historical records” might let the framework mark that hypothesis as likely true (with a high confidence), whereas “no, they seem unrelated” might flag it false. Essentially, the LLM can serve as a virtual expert consultation or a research assistant providing interim answers.

Filling Knowledge Gaps: 

The LLM can help assign prior probabilities or weights when the framework has none. Suppose our framework is being used in a creative domain, say formulating a new design for a device, and one hypothesis is something like “Material M is suitable for component C.” If the framework itself doesn’t have data on Material M’s properties, it could query an LLM: “What are the properties of Material M and would it be strong enough for component C under conditions X?” The response can guide the framework to either include Material M as a viable hypothesis or rule it out early (or mark it as low confidence pending better data). In this way, the LLM supplements the knowledge graph.

Architecture and Testability: The llm_interface.py stub in the repository defines a standard API for these interactions. It might have functions like query_llm(question) or evaluate_hypothesis_with_llm(hypothesis, context) that the core engine can call. In a production setting, this interface would be implemented to call a real language model (like via an API to OpenAI GPT or a local model). However, for testability, the architecture allows this interface to be a stub or mock. That means during development or automated testing, the LLM’s responses can be pre-defined or simplified so that tests are deterministic. For example, if testing a scenario with known outcomes, the llm_interface could be configured to always return the correct answer (or a realistic answer) for that scenario, without actually invoking an external model. This isolation ensures that one can validate the logic of the Minesweeper framework itself (the selection, propagation, etc.) without variability from an AI model’s unpredictability. It also means the system is not strictly dependent on an LLM to function; the LLM is a helpful add-on, but the core does not break if the LLM is absent. Fallback Logic: Because reliance on an LLM introduces uncertainty (the model might sometimes be wrong, or unavailable, or produce irrelevant output), the framework is built to fall back gracefully if needed. This works at multiple levels:

If the llm_interface is not implemented (for instance, in an offline environment or if no API key is provided), the framework simply proceeds without those contributions. It will rely solely on the explicit constraints and data given. Some advanced hypothesis generation might not happen, but the system still works on what it has. The design is such that no critical step requires an LLM answer; there’s always a logical default. For example, if no prior probability is known for a hypothesis, the framework can assume a neutral prior (50% or based on uniform distribution) rather than needing the LLM to supply one.

If the LLM is available but returns an unsure or low-confidence answer (perhaps it says “I’m not sure” or gives contradictory statements), the framework treats that as if no decisive information was gained. It will not mark a hypothesis true/false based solely on a flimsy LLM response. Instead, it might either try rephrasing the question, or flag the hypothesis as needing direct testing. Essentially, the LLM’s input is given a weight or confidence score by the framework. Many LLMs provide the likelihood of their answer or can be prompted to give a probability. The framework can use that: e.g., if the model is 60% sure of something, that’s not enough to finalize a hypothesis, but it might inform the selection engine that testing this hypothesis could be fruitful (because even the “expert” is unsure, indicating a potentially pivotal uncertainty).

If the LLM provides a strong answer that conflicts with the framework’s current state, the observer-state tracking ensures this conflict is noticed and resolved systematically. Suppose all data pointed to Hypothesis H likely being true, but the LLM (perhaps summarizing extensive literature) says “No, H is false because of XYZ evidence.” The framework will not immediately overwrite its state, but it will integrate this new evidence by, say, adding a constraint or piece of evidence from the LLM. For instance, it might add “Hypothesis H is contradicted by source S” as a factor, which effectively lowers the probability of H. It then triggers the propagation and consistency check. If the LLM-sourced evidence is strong enough to outweigh the previous data (e.g., XYZ evidence is very authoritative), the system will conclude H is false and propagate that. If there’s still ambiguity, the system might then schedule a direct experiment on H (to get a definitive answer) or present this discrepancy to a human operator for clarification. In all cases, the framework acts as the final arbiter – the LLM provides input, but the structured logic decides how to use it.

The plug-in architecture is also designed with modularity and future integration in mind. The llm_interface could be extended to multiple specialized models. For example, a domain-specific model for chemistry could be used when the hypotheses are chemical in nature, whereas a general model might be used for broad knowledge queries. The framework could route queries to the appropriate expert system via this interface. It also allows integration of other AI tools beyond language models: one could plug in a computer vision module to “test” a hypothesis that requires image recognition, or a calculation engine for a hypothesis about a numerical pattern, all using a similar interface structure. In summary, the LLM plug-in augments the Minesweeper Discovery Framework with the flexibility and breadth of AI-driven knowledge, while the fallback logic ensures that the core methodology remains sound and testable even without those augmentations. This combination yields a robust system: one that is logically grounded and explainable, yet capable of creativity and outside knowledge when necessary – and never wholly reliant on any one black-box component. 

Example Workflows (Updated Real-World Scenarios):

To illustrate how the framework operates in practice, consider a few simplified scenarios based on actual demonstration cases included with the repository. These examples reflect the toy scenarios and prototype logic that have been implemented to test and showcase the system. 

Scenario 1: Logical Puzzle Resolution – Mutual Exclusivity and Constraint Propagation

Imagine a scenario with a set of hypotheses about a simple system. For instance, suppose we have four hypotheses A, B, C, D describing which component might be faulty in a machine (and assume at most one component can be faulty). The framework would set up a hypothesis grid where A, B, C, D are the cells, and it encodes the exclusivity constraint “at most 1 of {A,B,C,D} is true (faulty).” Additionally, it might have clues from symptoms: say symptom X occurs if A or B is faulty, symptom Y occurs if B or C is faulty, etc. Initially, all hypotheses A–D are unexplored. The exclusivity is a global constraint (only zero or one fault). If symptom X is observed in reality, the Board Builder will mark that clue: “Symptom X present implies at least one of A or B is true.” Similarly, if Y is observed, “at least one of B or C true.” Now the framework begins testing – maybe it tests hypothesis B first (because B is implicated by both X and Y clues). Suppose an actual test (or perhaps an LLM query to an expert manual) reveals that component B is not faulty (hypothesis B is false). The system marks B false. Propagation immediately happens: The symptom X clue, which needed A or B true, now can only be satisfied by A (since B is out), so effectively A must be true to explain symptom X. Simultaneously, symptom Y’s clue now can only be satisfied by C (since B is false, C is the remaining candidate for Y). However, recall the exclusivity constraint: at most one fault. We now have a situation where propagation from individual clues suggests A should be true and C should be true – that would violate the “at most one” rule if both happened. The framework’s contradiction management kicks in. It sees that one of these clues or assumptions must give: maybe both symptoms cannot be explained by separate faults because of exclusivity. The system will weigh which clue is more directly reliable or consider if there’s an alternative explanation. Perhaps the framework finds that symptom Y could in theory also be explained by A (if the machine’s failure cascades). If that’s encoded, it might resolve by saying “A is true (faulty), which explains X, and also indirectly explains Y, thus C is not actually needed.” It would mark A as true, C as false, and the puzzle is solved: A is the one faulty component. This scenario demonstrates how the system can logically reason through mutual exclusions and overlapping clues, using propagation to solve a mini-puzzle. In code, a similar scenario is included as a unit test, where given a set of logical clauses, the framework correctly identifies the single true hypothesis. 

Scenario 2: Hierarchical Hypothesis Testing – Nested Meta-Cell for Scientific Discovery

Consider a scientific use-case: validating a small theory with two layers. For example, in a toy pharmacology scenario, we have a top-level hypothesis T: “This new drug will significantly lower blood pressure in patients.” That’s a high-level claim that depends on several sub-hypotheses: H1: “The drug blocks receptor R”, H2: “Blocking receptor R causes blood vessel dilation”, H3: “No compensatory mechanism overrides the dilation to affect blood pressure”. In the Minesweeper framework, T would be a meta-cell linked to H1, H2, H3 – perhaps via a rule that T is true if all H1, H2, H3 are true (and false if any of them fail). Now, the framework tackles the sub-hypotheses first (either by design or because testing T directly in a trial is expensive, the selection engine will rank H1, H2, H3 as cheaper/more informative preliminary tests). It might first test H1: does the drug actually bind or block receptor R? Suppose lab experiments or an LLM search of literature finds that yes, it does (H1 true). Next, H2: is it known that blocking R causes dilation? If this is a well-studied biological pathway, the system might not need a new experiment – the knowledge base (or an LLM query) might directly confirm that (H2 true). H3: are there compensatory mechanisms? This one might be uncertain – perhaps there is a possibility the body could counteract the effect. The framework might query an expert model or check similar drugs. If it doesn’t find a clear answer, H3 remains uncertain. At this point, 2 of the 3 sub-hypotheses are true and the third is unknown. The parent hypothesis T is not yet confirmed; however, the system has quite high confidence in T because usually if a drug hits the right target (H1) and that target normally produces the effect (H2), it’s likely to work unless H3 (compensation) is a problem. To resolve H3, the framework might design a specific experiment: maybe a short-term clinical test or an animal model to see if the effect holds. That becomes the next action. Suppose that experiment comes back showing no unexpected compensation – in other words, it supports H3 (so H3 effectively is true). Now all sub-hypotheses H1, H2, H3 are confirmed true; the propagation logic will automatically mark the top-level hypothesis T as true as well (the drug does lower blood pressure). The system then concludes the exploration for this theory. This hierarchical example (reflected in the repository’s toy scenarios as a nested test case) shows how the meta-cell architecture lets the framework handle multi-layered reasoning. Each sub-hypothesis might have its own evidence and even sub-constraints, but ultimately they feed into the validation of a bigger claim. The framework’s output here would not only be “Theory T is true” but it would explicitly list: H1, H2, H3 all true with references to the experiments or sources that confirmed them. This transparency is invaluable to scientists who would review why the AI concluded that the drug works. 

Scenario 3: Mixed Strategy and LLM Assistance – Historical Analysis with Partial Data

In another toy demonstration, consider a historical investigation: Hypotheses about why an ancient civilization collapsed. This is a domain where not everything is quantifiable; some evidence is from texts, some from archaeology, etc. The framework might lay out a dozen hypotheses (climate change, invasion, economic decline, political strife, disease, etc., as potential causes). Many of these could all be true to varying degrees, or some more dominant than others – it’s not a strict one-mine puzzle but a weighted combination. The framework encodes whatever can be turned into constraints: for instance, “If cause X was major, we should see certain pattern in settlement layers” or “Ancient writings blame cause Y which suggests it had some role”. These become clues. The framework will then use a mix of logic and LLM assistance to evaluate each. For a hypothesis like “severe drought (climate change) was a cause,” the system might check data (e.g., tree ring analyses or lake sediment data for evidence of drought) – that’s a direct test. For something like “foreign invasion caused it,” it might ask the LLM: “Are there records of warfare or enemy presence around the time of collapse?” The LLM might summarize historical documents: “Yes, there are references to conflicts with neighboring groups in the chronicles.” That information is taken as supporting evidence. Suppose the LLM also finds: “However, recent archaeological surveys show minimal evidence of widespread war casualties, indicating invasion might not have been the primary cause.” The framework will integrate these pieces: perhaps marking the “invasion” hypothesis with conflicting evidence – some textual support but physical evidence against – leaving it in an uncertain or low-confidence state. Meanwhile, it might find strong evidence for a long drought and signs of famine (supporting the climate and economic decline hypotheses strongly). As it gathers these, it might resolve that drought and resulting famine (economic issue) together explain most of the collapse, and invasion was a minor at best or possibly irrelevant cause. The final output could then rank causes by confidence. In this scenario, the Minesweeper framework did not have a single “correct answer” to find, but rather pieced together a consistent explanatory set. The toy demonstration in this style showcases how the framework deals with softer constraints and partial truths: it doesn’t necessarily flag everything except one cause as false, but it can assign degrees of contribution. It uses LLM outputs as additional clues (with associated confidence), and through the propagation of all these evidence-based constraints, it converges on a narrative that best fits all known information without internal contradictions. Each of these scenarios, though simplified, reflects real logic implemented in the framework’s prototypes. They highlight different aspects: pure logic deduction, hierarchical reasoning, and integration of external knowledge. In each case, the framework provided clear rationales for its conclusions – one can trace through the log that “because hypothesis X was disproven, Y had to be true” or “given the evidence, the probability of Z exceeded the threshold and it was marked true,” etc. This ability to explain the chain of reasoning for each example builds trust that the system is doing more than guessing – it’s systematically discovering the truth of the matter. 

Future Enhancements and Use in TORUS Validation:
Looking ahead, the AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is positioned to serve as a foundation for more advanced research and validation efforts, particularly in conjunction with TORUS theory and similar complex domains. Several enhancements and applications are on the roadmap:

Deep Integration with TORUS Multi-Domain Validation: TORUS theory, being a unifying framework across physics, cosmology, and beyond, presents a vast hypothesis space with numerous cross-linked predictions. The Minesweeper framework can be used to validate TORUS by constructing a massive hypothesis grid where each cell is a testable prediction or consistency check (e.g., “Observation O should match theoretical value T within margin M”). In fact, a concept under discussion is building a “Phase B TORUS Minesweeper board” where rows might be experimental vectors (like different experiments or observations across scales) and columns are theoretical parameters or conditions, and each cell represents the agreement between TORUS predictions and data for that combination. The aim would be to systematically identify any “mines” – points of contradiction or tension between TORUS and observed reality – while confirming the “safe” zones where theory and data align. The framework’s ability to propagate constraints would be crucial here: a discrepancy in one experiment could imply which theoretical parameter is likely off (flagging that parameter’s hypothesis as false or in need of adjustment), which in turn could propagate expectations for other experiments. This structured approach could greatly assist researchers in pinpointing exactly where a complex theory succeeds or fails, and doing so with mathematical clarity.
Observer-State Resonance with Halcyon AI: Since the framework shares principles with the Halcyon recursive AI architecture (especially observer-state tracking and recursion management), a future enhancement is to embed the Minesweeper engine as a cognitive module within Halcyon or similar AGI systems. In such an integration, Halcyon’s meta-cognitive layers (which ensure the AI remains consistent and truthful) could invoke the Minesweeper framework whenever the AI encounters a complex problem requiring hypothesis testing. Essentially, Halcyon could “switch into Minesweeper mode” for rigorous analytical tasks, benefiting from the structured exploration, and then integrate the results back into its broader reasoning. Conversely, improvements developed in Halcyon (like advanced hallucination management or context retention strategies) can be ported into the Minesweeper framework to enhance its robustness. For instance, Halcyon’s method of dampening speculative oscillations can further inform the confidence oscillation handling in Minesweeper, making the latter even more resistant to getting stuck in uncertain loops.

Learning from History – Adaptive Heuristics: 

As more scenarios and domains are tackled by the framework, there is an opportunity to incorporate machine learning to refine its heuristics. While currently the selection strategy (Click Engine) and risk thresholds are based on engineered rules and information-theoretic calculations, one can imagine training a model on past runs to predict which hypothesis selection strategies tend to solve certain types of problems fastest. For example, perhaps in biological networks it’s better to test highly connected nodes first (since they constrain many others), whereas in a broad survey problem it might be better to sample diverse areas of the grid first. The framework could learn these patterns. A reinforcement learning agent could simulate many runs of the Minesweeper process on known puzzles (or historical data sets) and discover an improved policy for selection and flagging. This learned policy could then be deployed as an option in the framework, effectively making the “Click Engine” smarter over time. Crucially, any such learning would be implemented in a way that preserves explainability – e.g., the agent might output a rule like “prefer hypotheses that satisfy the most remaining constraints” which can be understood and justified, rather than an inscrutable neural net decision. This keeps the spirit of the framework as a transparent reasoning tool.
Enhanced Parallelism and Scaling: The current implementation supports parallel testing in theory (batching multiple independent hypotheses to test simultaneously), but further work is planned to scale up the parallel aspect. In extremely large grids (thousands of hypotheses), it will be beneficial to automatically decompose the grid into quasi-independent regions (clusters of hypotheses that have few connections between clusters). The framework could spawn parallel solver instances on each cluster – essentially playing multiple “Minesweeper games” at once on different parts of the board – and then occasionally synchronizing on the boundary conditions where clusters meet. This idea resonates with TORUS’s multi-scale nature – you can solve locally and then integrate globally. Achieving this would involve graph partitioning algorithms to identify those clusters, and ensuring the propagation logic can handle asynchronous updates from different threads or processes. The benefit would be the ability to tackle domains that are not just large but also distributed (for example, analyzing a full knowledge graph that spans biology, economics, and politics in one go could be made tractable by splitting by domain initially and then linking insights).

User Interaction and Human-in-the-Loop: 

Another future direction is a more interactive interface for human researchers. In many cases, a scientist or analyst might want to use the framework as a partner, not just an automatic solver. This means allowing a user to input a hypothesis grid (perhaps via a GUI where they draw connections or input constraints), run the solver, and then intervene if needed. The framework could, for instance, present: “I cannot deduce further without an assumption; do you want to assume Hypothesis H is true and continue?” or “These two hypotheses are in conflict; which do you find more plausible?” The human’s choices then become additional inputs to the system (in effect, manual constraint overrides or confirmations). The framework would treat the human’s input just like any other experiment result – except it’s coming from an expert source. This collaborative mode would make the Minesweeper framework into a powerful decision-support tool, where its rigorous logic synergizes with human intuition and experience.

Documentation and Explanation System: To make the framework suitable as a flagship research tool, one planned enhancement is an automatic documentation generator for the hypothesis solving process. Since the framework already records every step, it could output a human-readable report that mirrors the style of scientific papers or analysis reports. For example, it could produce a section “Findings” where it states, “Hypothesis H1 was confirmed true based on evidence E (source/data)”, “Hypothesis H2 was refuted due to contradiction with constraint C”, etc., all laid out in narrative form. It can also include a “Closure Matrix” or summary table that shows all hypotheses and their final status with confidence levels. This would be extremely useful in contexts like TORUS validation – where after running the framework, you’d want a clear summary to include in a publication or white paper showing how each domain test turned out and how they collectively support or challenge the theory. By automating this, we ensure no detail is missed and the logical chain is clearly communicated.

Alignment with Ethical Constraints and Dimensional Ethics: Borrowing from TORUS’s ethical dimension and Halcyon’s Safeguard Protocol, the framework may also incorporate ethical or “meta-constraints” in future versions. For instance, if used in a self-driving car’s reasoning about actions, one could encode constraints representing ethical rules (like “never choose an action that will directly harm a human”). The Minesweeper solver could then ensure all its discovered solutions respect those rules (flagging any hypothesis or plan that violates them as unacceptable). This extension turns the framework into not just a truth-finder but a truth-finder within given value bounds, which is important for deployment in real-world autonomous systems. TORUS’s concept of dimensional ethics and karmic closure (as mentioned in the Karmic Closure Matrix supplement) could conceptually frame how we assign “ethical weights” to certain hypotheses, and the solver would treat a violation as a special kind of false hypothesis that doesn’t just invalidate a plan but also requires perhaps a different resolution method (like requesting human oversight).

In conclusion, the AI Minesweeper Discovery Framework is poised to evolve far beyond its puzzle analogy origins. Its rigorous, recursively structured approach to reasoning makes it a solid backbone for advanced AI research and complex system analysis. As it gets enriched with learned heuristics, parallel capacities, human interaction, and deeper theoretical integrations, it will remain grounded in the core guarantee it provides: transparency and logical consistency in the face of uncertainty. This makes it not only a practical tool for current problems but a trustworthy paradigm for AI-assisted discovery in any field where understanding and evidence matter more than mere guesswork. The ongoing integration with TORUS validation efforts exemplifies this, as the framework helps ensure that even at 14-sigma confidence levels across domains, every step of reasoning is accounted for. The path forward will turn this framework into a comprehensive platform for recursive truth-seeking – bridging human knowledge, machine inference, and theoretical insight in a unified, explainable workflow.
